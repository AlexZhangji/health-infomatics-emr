** NOTE TO DEVELOPERS  **
**************************
This is only a placeholder page only used when a user refreshes a web page that was half-way 
through an initialization, update, or error filter 

This page is not reached otherwise.  The StartupFilters are placed first in the hierarchy of
servlets in our web.xml.  That web.xml stops any kind of spring startup if the user needs 
initialization, db updating, or if there was an error.

See 
org.openmrs.web.filter.initialization.InitializationFilter.java
org.openmrs.web.filter.update.UpdateFilter.java
org.openmrs.web.filter.startuperror.StartupErrorFilter.java

and the velocity *.vm scripts associated with them to edit the initialsetup ui.
